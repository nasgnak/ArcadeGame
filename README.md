Welcome to my 2D game! The rules are simple. Please see below! Good luck!

TO START THE GAME:
- ensure all .html, .css, .js, and .png files are locally stored in the same area,
  with the .png files all in its own file titled, "images"
- double-click on index.html.

TO PLAY THE GAME:
- use the arrow keys to navigate your player to try and get to the river!
- but avoid the bugs! if you run into them, you'll have to start all over.
- DEVELOPERS: if you have the console on, make sure that the active window is on the game.
